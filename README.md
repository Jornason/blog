# Github Pages Modified from Jekyll-now

This Page contains two main parts: 

1. The homepage is a single web page with a list of my personal projects, have a look if you want;
2. The blog is a new project, I will update it as frequently as I can. And most of the posts will be related to Technology and Coding, some about Design and Human-Computer Interaction. Hope you like it.

Any advices or ideas, please feel free to [email me](mailto:zzgary92@gmail.com).
