Due to a big bug in MongoDB < 2.6 version, I lost maybe 20% data... The bug is pretty famous back to that time :) Caused by the limitation of MongoDB(16MB)...Since I set up all the server on my raspberry pi, the only available version of MongoDB for it is 2.1.1... so sad... I don't know why I can not export all data to my local.. I can only export like 80% percent of them... still haven't figured out why ...

But anyway, this is kind of a good thing. You know, better be sooner :). And also this makes me decide to release the feedpusher as a packaged tool that you can use to built your own rss reader instead of a real service provider :)

So I have to say: there will be no beta test for feedpusher, since I have closed the test user account... so you can not log in with that `test@mail.com` any more, sorry :) But I have released all source code on github(separated into two different repo: [feedpusher](https://github.com/taoalpha/feedpusher) and [baby](https://github.com/taoalpha/baby)). I will clear the code and combine them into the refactor branch of feedpusher soon.

For personal use, it will work great and provide high customizability! And in order to learn react, I will release the code with angular version and react version :)

Sorry for closing the test account, when I set up the authenticate level part, I will reopen it but for pure demo purpose. I just can not let some people ruin my database... :) I got a lot attact from China... I don't know why... so sad... it's my motherland, you should be nicer to me!!! :)

Good night!
